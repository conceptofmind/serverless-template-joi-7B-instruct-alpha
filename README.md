# üçå Banana Serverless

This repo gives a framework to serve Joi 7B instruct models in production using simple HTTP servers.

# Quickstart

What is Open Assistant?
Open Assistant is a project meant to give everyone access to a great chat based large language model.

We believe that by doing this we will create a revolution in innovation in language. In the same way that stable-diffusion helped the world make art and images in new ways we hope Open Assistant can help improve the world by improving language itself.

Prompt the model by typing:
User: followed by your question. The agent will reply as Joi
The name Joi is loosely inspired by a friendly fictional AI assistant in the movies.

For multiple rounds of dialogue:
After your question add two new lines followed by Joi: (\n\nJoi:)
